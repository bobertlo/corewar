Vampire warriors, rather than throwing DAT bombs, they throw JMP pointers
into the core. These pointers point to a placed trap. Once any enemy process 
steps on one of those pointers, it is immediately transfered to the trap and 
forced to do the slave works for vampire warriors.<P>

Earlier incarnation of vampires worked like below:
<listing>	;name Vampire 1

	const EQU 2365

	loc   MOV ptr, ptr     ; throw JMP pointer to core
	      ADD #const, ptr  ; update pointer
	      SUB #const, loc  ; update location
	      JMP loc          ; loop back

	ptr   JMP @0, trap     ; the pointer weapon

	trap  SPL 1, -100      ; this is where the pointer points to
	      MOV bomb, &lt;-1    ; core-clear
	      JMP trap
	bomb  DAT #0</listing>

This warrior throws pointers one for every 5 instructions (modulo 5).
The constant has been chosen to <A HREF="misc.htm#pattern">work well</A> with
<A HREF="misc.htm#modulo">modulo 5</A>. Note that the next pointer and the
next location are updated by the same constant but reversed in sign.<P>

The trap here simply forces all processes in it to accumulate more processes
and to execute <A HREF="misc.htm#coreClear">core-clear</A>. The standard
<A HREF="misc.htm#selfSplit">self-splitting</A> is not used here so that
the slavers can execute self-destruct once they finish core-clear.<P>

Modern vampires use more effective procedure:
<listing>	;name Vampire 2

	const EQU 2365

	      SPL 0            ; self splitting
	vamp  MOV ptr, @ptr    ; throw pointer
	      ADD data, ptr    ; update pointer
              DJN vamp, &lt;2339  ; loop back + non-lethal attack

	ptr   JMP trap, ptr    ; pointer to...

	trap  SPL 1, -100      ; ...here
	      MOV data, &lt;-1
	      JMP -2
	data  DAT #const, #-const</listing>

The only changes here are the main component (vampire) and the pointer
structure. Pointer is now updated at once. With this change, it permits
<A HREF="misc.htm#selfSplit">self-splitting</A> mechanism for harder
shell (protection). Another improvement is that the vampire throws pointers 
faster than before. The gained speed is approximately 30%.<P>

Samples of vampire warriors are: 
<A HREF="sucker5.red">Sucker</A>, 
<A HREF="pittrap.red">PitTrap</A>,
<A HREF="twilight.red">Twilight Pits</A>, and many others.<P>
